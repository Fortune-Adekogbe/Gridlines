# Gridlines

This project is an attempt to track the power and energy generated by the Nigerian National Grid through time using data from the Ministry of Power.

## Dashboard
The dashboard created at the end of this project can be accessed in multiple ways using Streamlit or Dash.

### Live Streamlit Dashboard
The live dashboard is avaliable at https://gridlines.streamlit.app/.

###  Local Streamlit Dashboard
The local streamlit dashboard can be created by following the following steps:

#### Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Fortune-Adekogbe/Gridlines.git
```

#### Install requirements via `pip`
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Run the streamlit app
```
streamlit run app.py
```

###  Local Dash Dashboard
The local streamlit dashboard can be created by following the following steps:

#### Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Fortune-Adekogbe/Gridlines.git
```

#### Install requirements via `pip`
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Run the dash app
```
python powerlines.py
```

## Possible Future Work
- Adding summaries of the grid's performance per month
- Predicting the likelihood of grid collapse
- Filling in gaps in data using predictive methods
- Adding news information to complement data in carring out points 2 and 3. Possibly also adding news summaries to the dashboard for more context.

- The Federal Ministry of Power, Nigeria for publishing grid data.
